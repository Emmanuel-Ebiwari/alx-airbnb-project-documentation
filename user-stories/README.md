# 🧾 User Stories – Airbnb Clone Backend

## 📌 Objective

This document translates the functional interactions from the Airbnb Clone use case diagram into user stories. Each story captures a specific system behavior from the user's perspective to guide backend development.

## 📄 What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability (usually a user or admin of the system). They are used in Agile development to communicate requirements clearly.

## ✍️ Format

All stories follow the format:

> "As a [user type], I want to [do something] so that [I get some benefit]."

## 📂 Files

- `user-stories.md`: Contains a set of user stories for core functionalities like registration, property management, booking, and payment.

## ✅ Purpose

These user stories serve as a foundational reference for developers and stakeholders to:

- Understand what functionality is expected.
- Prioritize development tasks.
- Build features aligned with user needs.
